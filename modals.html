          You recently heard about the Datalab but you don't really know what it stands for? Well, you are in the right place.
          This page has been made to give you all the information, news, services and documentation regarding Datalab activities.
          We are also releasing today the access to our new data science platform called <b>Sparrow</b>. It's a big day for the Datalab, and all of this would not have been possible without the help of our managers as well as the TPS and ITG teams.
          So a big thank you to all of them, and please enjoy the result of our hard work!

          It has been 2 months since we made the Datalab digital kick-off. Today is a very important day for us. We celebrate the version 0.2 of sparrow,
          our artificial intelligence platform, built thanks to your feedback.
          Today, we also want to give you something. We are releasing all our current projects to you, as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source">InnerSource</a> initiative.
          We do believe that building nice data software comes with an organized, clean and collaborative code. It is by sharing our innovations and good practices
          among the BNP Paribas data community that we can build smarter applications, together. So if you desire to be a contributor, feel free to
          <a href="mailto:datalabpf@bnpparibas-pf.com">send us an email</a> or to come at the Datalab's co-working space on Unicity first floor.
